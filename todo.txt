We recently made a z80 emulator cli
program romwbw_emu. It uses underlying 
emulator cpmemu. For a UI we made ioscpm.
These are all gitub repositories in our account.

You should be able to use cpmemu and romwbw_emu 
with no changes (maybe linux vs windows build issues).
ioscpm is written in switch and I guess not usable here.

For this project:
Create new (for now) private repostioru z80cpmw
for a windows port.

Create a windows program to do more or less the same thing
as ioscpm (feel free to use windows conventions for looks and menus etc,
just need the functionality).

Claude in a broser suggested WinUI 3 whatever that is.
Use whatever is the most native windows and the windows store likes best.
I installed git, gh and claude with power shell.
No VS studio yet. install it or tell me how if needed.
